                <p>This week overall went well for me. I fixed some Chromebooks, returned some, and worked on my website. Fixing Chromebooks was easy but I struggled getting my website up on the web. Some of the files won't show up so I had to adjust the locations and paths of those files and I eventually got it to work.</p>
