                <p>This week overall went well for me. I fixed some Chromebooks, returned some, and worked on my website. Fixing Chromebooks was easy but I struggled getting my website up on the web. Some of the files won't show up so I had to adjust the locations and paths of those files and I eventually got it to work.</p>

                <h1>Starting The 20%</h1>
                <h5>4/14/2022</h5>
                <p>I started working on my 20% project this week. I layed out some of the basic stuff for my business website and will soon be making it easy on the eyes and not just a bunch of text. I also fixed a bunch of chromebooks in which one kid even stabbed the LCD or something like that. I learned that middle schoolers are weird creatures who like to destroy their Chromebooks. Next week I hope to have a lot of the groundwork for my website layed out.</p>
