                <h1>Website Struggles</h1>
                <h5>4/8/2022</h5>
                <p>This week overall went well for me. I fixed some Chromebooks, returned some, and worked on my website. Fixing Chromebooks was easy but I struggled getting my website up on the web. Some of the files won't show up so I had to adjust the locations and paths of those files and I eventually got it to work.</p>

                <h1>Starting The 20%</h1>
                <h5>4/14/2022</h5>
                <p>I started working on my 20% project this week. I layed out some of the basic stuff for my business website and will soon be making it easy on the eyes and not just a bunch of text. I also fixed a bunch of chromebooks in which one kid even stabbed the LCD or something like that. I learned that middle schoolers are weird creatures who like to destroy their Chromebooks. Next week I hope to have a lot of the groundwork for my website layed out.</p>

                <h1>The 22 Issue</h1>
                <h5>4/22/2022</h5>
                <p>This week there have been a lot of issues with the C722’s. The main issue I've seen is the touchpad stops working. Most of the time there’s no easy fix for them so we have to send them into Acer to get fixed.</p>

                <h5>4/29/2022</h5>
                <p>It was a pretty normal week. Just fixed Chromebooks and worked on my 20% project.  There was one chromebook that came in where the kid ripped out the bottom portion of keys and stomped on the screen with his foot, but other than that it was a normal week.</p>

                <h5>5/6/2022</h5>
                <p>It was a pretty normal week. Not too many repairs, but enough to keep us busy. Nothing really special or exciting happened except for that the Crypto Marketing is down.</p>

                <h5>5/13/2022</h5>
                <p>There was a moderate level of repairs this week and re actually ran out of replacement LCD screens. We can't order anymore right now with we’ve had to take from the decom pile. On Friday we cleaned up the room a bit because the people at ChromeHero are coming to film some testimonials and some other things about our operation at the school.</p>
