                <h1>The Food Pantry</h1>
                <h5>4/19/2022</h5>
                <p>“A local food pantry needs to create a website, which will be run by several volunteers. The volunteers will need to update item availability, announcements, and pop up locations. They would also like to have a feature for people to order their food pantry selections online, however the items available change daily. These volunteers have average technology skills. The website needs to be very easy to navigate and understand, and look great on phones.” Wix is one of the most popular website builders out there and would be perfect for this food pantry. Wix is very easy to use, no coding knowledge needed, and its packed with features. Keeping inventory on wix is easy, you just go to the designated tab and you can see a bunch of information about each item. Also its really easy to make your website look nice without spending a bunch of time doing it. Wix also has low prices so anyone can afford their services.</p>
